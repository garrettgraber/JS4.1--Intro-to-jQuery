		<h1>Celebrity Jeopardy</h1>
		<h2>Start</h2>

		<p>Alex Trebek: Welcome to Celebrity Jeopardy: Rock and Roll Edition, where some of today's biggest musics are competing for their favorite charities. Let's meet the contestants: Dave Matthews of Dave Matthews Band. Dave, welcome to the show. Dave Matthews: [in squeaky voice] I am glad to be here. Alex Trebek: Fantastic. Next up, Icelandic sensation Bjork. Bjork: When I look at the veins in my hands, they remind me of these two snakes that laugh. Alex Trebek: Beautiful. And our final contestant on Celebrity Rock and Roll Jeopardy... <a href='http://www.google.com'>Sean Connery.</a> Sean Connery: We meet again, you loggerheaded tickle brain poppycock! I cut an album of filthy limericks just so I'd be eligible: "There once was a man named Trebick, who had the most tiniest..."</p>

		<h2>Middle</h2>

		<p>Alex Trebek: Enough. Let's just get this over with. Here are the categories, they are: "Potent Potables," "Countries Between Mexico and Canada," "Members of Simon and Garfunkel," "I Have a Chardonnay" - you choose this category, you automatically get the points and I get to have a glass of wine. "Things You Do With a Pencil Sharpener," "Tie Your Shoe," and finally, "Toast". Mr. Connery, you select first. Sean Connery: That's a nice jacket you're wearing, Trebek. Alex Trebek: Why, thank you. <a href="http://www.google.com">Sean Connery:</a> Is that wool? Must have been expensive. Alex Trebek: No, actually, it was quite reasonable. Sean Connery: Really? Where did you get it? Alex Trebek: At a place called Stern's, down on 14th. Sean Connery: Stern's? I'll have to check it out. Alex Trebek: Well, you should. Ask for Gary. Tell him that I sent you. Sean Connery: I'll do that. That sure is a nice jacket. Just one more question... Alex Trebek: What is it, Sean? Sean Connery: Do they make them for men?</p>


		<h2>End</h2>


		<p>Alex Trebek: Let's just go with "Toast" for $600. And the answer is, "This is the thing that becomes toast". [Dave Matthews buzzes in] Dave Matthews? Dave Matthews: What? <a href="http://www.google.com">Alex Trebek:</a> Did you ring in? Dave Matthews: [singing] I did it, guilty as charged. Alex Trebek: Do you have an answer? Dave Matthews: No. No, I don't. [Bjork buzzes in] Alex Trebek: Bjork, this is the only thing that becomes toast.</p>
